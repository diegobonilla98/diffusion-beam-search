# Enhanced Diffusion Sampling with Search-Based Methods

This project explores advanced sampling techniques for diffusion models that go beyond the standard reverse diffusion process. By implementing search-based methods like Best-of-N sampling and Beam Search, we aim to improve image generation quality by allowing the model to explore more of the generation space and select optimal paths.

## üéØ Project Overview

Traditional diffusion models follow a deterministic reverse sampling process, generating images step-by-step from noise to final output. This project investigates whether **search-based sampling methods** can improve generation quality by:

1. **Exploring multiple candidate paths** at each denoising step
2. **Evaluating path quality** using forward likelihood estimation
3. **Selecting optimal trajectories** through the generation space

## üî¨ Methodology

### Core Innovation: Forward Likelihood Estimation

We developed a novel **Forward Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)** metric to evaluate the quality of diffusion model predictions at each step:

```
NLL = 0.5 * log(2œÄ * variance_t) + 0.5 * (||Œµ_pred||¬≤ / d)
```

Where:
- `Œµ_pred` is the predicted noise
- `variance_t` is the noise variance at timestep t
- `d` is the dimensionality of the latent space
- **Lower values indicate better predictions**

This metric assesses how plausible the predicted noise is under the forward diffusion process, providing a reliable proxy for prediction confidence and model performance.

### Implemented Methods

#### 1. Standard Pipeline (`1_standard_pipeline.py`)
- Baseline implementation using the default Stable Diffusion 1.5 pipeline
- Single deterministic path through the reverse process
- Minimal computational overhead

#### 2. Forward Process Implementation (`2_for_pipeline.py`)
- Manual implementation of the diffusion forward process
- Foundation for implementing custom sampling strategies
- Direct control over each denoising step

#### 3. Likelihood Estimation (`3_step_linkelihood_estimation.py`)
- Implementation of forward NLL computation
- Visualization of prediction quality throughout the sampling process
- Analysis of score function estimates and their statistics

#### 4. Best-of-N Sampling (`4_best_of_N_sampling.py`)
- Generate N candidate samples at each step
- Select the candidate with the lowest forward NLL
- **Excellent results with minimal computational overhead**

#### 5. Beam Search Sampling (`5_beam_search_diffusion_sampling.py`)
- Maintain multiple beams (candidate paths) throughout generation
- Use lookahead evaluation for better path selection
- More sophisticated but computationally intensive approach
